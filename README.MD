# Service Discovery Patterns with ASP.NET Core

This repo contains a samples of implementing Service Discovery patterns with ASP.NET Core using tools like [Consul](https://www.consul.io) and [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/)

These were originally used as demos for a talk I gave at a [dotNet Miami Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/dotNetMiami/events/232614545/).

### Patterns Covered
- [Point to Point](point_to_point) <- start here :)
- [Local Registry](local_registry)
- [Self Registration](self_registration)
- [Health Checks](health_checks)
- [Load Balancing](load_balancing)


#### Built With
